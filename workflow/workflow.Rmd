```{r setup, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here("workflow"))
read_chunk("load.R")
read_chunk("do.R")
```

## `read_chunk`

- codes can be reusable across several documents

- run R codes continuously in a separate file

- save time as you do not have to recompile the whole document to see the results




## Load packages

```{r, load-pkgs}
```
