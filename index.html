## Statistical Consultancy Service at USJ

Goals:

- To provide statistical consulting  to the university researchers and industrial organizations


- To provide an opportunity for BSc (Honours) Statistics undergraduates  to train as statistical consultants 

---

## At the successful completion of this unit, you will learn

- how statistics are applied in the real world

- how to work on multiple problems

- how to work under time constraints

- how to communicate with non statisticians

---
**A student needs at least 80% attendance in all of the following activities**

1. lectures - at least 80% 

2. Meeting with clients - at least 80% 

3. Meeting with consultants and coordinator - at least 80% 

The expectation of 80% attendance will allow for unavoidable or legitimate absences such as an illness that requires the student to miss all of his or her classes for 2 days or more, a period of grief for loss of a family member or friend

Failure to maintain at least 80% attendance in all activities - (negative 10 marks)

Final mark: Total marks + (-10)

# What does statistical consultant do?

.bold[.orange[Provide statistical advice, analysis and training]]

--
  - Providing assistance for study design, data collection, experimental design
  
--
    
  - Guiding in determining required sample size for valid results
  
--
    
  - Assisting with selecting an software package for data analysis
  
--
    
  - Working with client to select and conduct statistical analysis
  
--
    
  - Coaching clients with the interpretation, writing-up and explaining of results

---

# Responsibilities

- Understand the research question

- Help the client define his or her problem

- Translate research questions into problems that can be analysed with data

- Determine the appropriate type of statistical analysis

- Translate findings back to the clients (interpret data)

- **Keep records of what you do**



---
## Skills

- Communication skills

    - to be able to talk to clients
    
    - understand their language (technical terms, etc)
    
    - communicate statistics effectively
    
    - ability to ask questions
    
    - ability to listen


- Time-management skills/ Meet deadlines

- Networking talents

- Work on multiple projects

---

### Factors that make the consulting process complicated

- difficulty in establishing the client's wants and needs

- training and experience of the consultant

- individual style of the consultant

- most problems do not have a unique solution

- knowledge of the client

- resources available to client and consultant

- the state of the problem (no design, data collected, etc.).

# Difficulties faced by the consultants

.red[Not all projects have gone as smoothly or been as productive.]

- Clients want to run an inappropriate statistical methods

- Clients may seek statistical help after data collection, and data do not support to answer the research question

- Working with clients who think they know statistics

- Dealing with clients "who only want an answer"

- Dealing with impatient clients

- Being constrained by lack of time or other resources

---
## Challenges

- Working on multiple projects

- Working with large messy datasets

- Keeping up with new techniques

---

# Asking Good Questions


&gt; "Better a poor answer to the right question than a good answer to the wrong question."

&gt; John W Tukey

- We want to answer the client's question. Hence, we must ask right questions to get all necessary information  without intimidating or insulting the client.

---

# Asking Good Questions


- Plan **What information do we need?**

- Welcome the client and made them feel comfortable

- Ask questions to get necessary information
        
    - Listen carefully
        
    - Slow down
    
    - Clarify all terms
    
    - Ask if you do not understand
    
    - Take notes, if needed

# Question types

---

# Close probe questions (usually with Yes  or No)

- Did you interview every person on the list?

- Are there any missing values?

---

# Open probes (long responses)

- What factors are likely to affect the response?

- I’d like to hear more about the independent variables you  plan to measure.

- Is there anything more that we should discuss related to food packaging types before we go on to discuss the variables
you plan to measure?

---

# Ask if you don’t understand

Restate factual information and make sure you have gotten everything correct.

- Let me make sure that I understand ...

- Do I have this correctly?

- So a sampling unit is an individual person, is that correct?

## Cognitive Principles

Less conginitive effort to read the chart (what is presented) and save the time to think about the content of the chart

- Good visualizations take advantage of the human visual system's ability to process information with little effort.

## Preattentive graph perception

It requires no conscious effort from the viewer to do understand what is presented through the design. It's automated and takes between 200-500 milliseconds to complete in the spatial memory.

(**Spatial** working **memory** entails the ability to keep spatial information active in working memory over a short period of time.)
